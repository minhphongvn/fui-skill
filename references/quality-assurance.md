# Module Assessment & Quality Assurance

This guide defines the protocol for critiquing, assessing, and optimizing FUI modules. Use this skill when the user asks to "Review", "Assess", or "Critique" a module.

## Assessment Protocol

When assessing a module, perform the following 3-step analysis:

### 1. Code Quality & Architecture Review
*   **Structure**: Does the module follow the standard directory structure (`module.json`, `script.js`, `_info.json`, `styles/`)?
*   **JSON Standards**: Are `module.json` keys valid? Are `attr` and `col` used correctly?
*   **Separation of Concerns**: Is complex logic moved to `script.js` instead of cluttering JSON?
*   **Clean Code**: Are variable names consistent? Is dead code removed?

### 2. Logic & Edge Case Analysis
Identify potential failures in real-world scenarios.
*   **Data Validation**: Are required fields checked before submission? What happens if fields are empty?
*   **State Management**: Does the module handle loading states? Is there a risk of race conditions?
*   **User Flow**:
    *   *Scenario*: User clicks "Back" mid-process. Does data persist?
    *   *Scenario*: User inputs invalid numbers/dates. Is it handled gracefully?
*   **Security**: Are permissions checked? Is sensitive data exposed?

### 3. Best Practice Proposals
Propose optimization based on FUI standards.
*   **Performance**: Can big lists become virtualized? Are there unnecessary re-renders?
*   **UX**: Can steps be combined? Are error messages clear?
*   **Maintainability**: Can repetitive validation be refactored into a helper function?

## Output Format

When delivering an assessment, structure your response as follows:

## Module Assessment Report

### 🚨 Critical Issues
*   [Logic] Missing validation on "Amount" field allows negative numbers.
*   [UX] "Submit" button remains active during loading, allowing double submission.

### ⚠️ Improvements
*   [Architecture] Move the 50-line validation logic from JSON to `script.js`.
*   [UI] Use `f-date` instead of text input for date fields.

### 💡 Best Practice Proposals
*   **Refactor**: Create a `validateForm()` function to handle all checks centrally.
*   **UX**: Add a progress spinner when calling `apiLuu`.

### 🧪 Edge Cases to Verify
1.  User deletes a row from `dsDienGiai` then tries to submit.
2.  User uploads a file larger than 20MB.
